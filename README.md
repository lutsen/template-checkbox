Lagan Properties Checkbox Input Template
========================================

Admin template for Lagan properties that require checkbox input.
Every checkbox is associated with a hidden field of the same name, placed just before the checkbox. This way, the property is always submitted, also if the checkbox is not checked. This is needed for Lagan to work.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.land/) from [HoverKraft](http://www.hoverkraft.nl/).
